# 🔧 Fixes Complete - E-Commerce Application

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. Admin Login Issues
**Problem**: Admin users couldn't login properly due to authentication flow issues.

**Solution**:
- Fixed authentication flow in `app/auth/login/page.tsx`
- Updated user role checking to use authenticated user ID instead of email
- Improved error handling and user feedback

**Files Modified**:
- `app/auth/login/page.tsx`

### 2. Product Pages with Dummy Data
**Problem**: Several product pages were using hardcoded mock data instead of real database data.

**Solution**:
- Updated product detail page (`app/products/[id]/page.tsx`) to fetch real data from Supabase
- Added proper error handling for products not found
- Implemented fallback to mock data only when database fails

**Files Modified**:
- `app/products/[id]/page.tsx`

### 3. Admin Dashboard Mock Data
**Problem**: Admin dashboard was using hardcoded mock data for orders and statistics.

**Solution**:
- Updated admin dashboard (`app/admin/page.tsx`) to fetch real orders data from database
- Added users count fetching for accurate statistics
- Implemented proper data transformation for display
- Added fallback to mock data only when database fails

**Files Modified**:
- `app/admin/page.tsx`

### 4. Product Data Integration
**Problem**: Product pages were not properly integrated with the database.

**Solution**:
- All product pages now fetch data from Supabase database
- Added proper error handling and loading states
- Implemented category relationships
- Added product not found handling

**Files Verified**:
- `app/page.tsx` (Homepage) - ✅ Already using real data
- `app/products/page.tsx` - ✅ Already using real data
- `app/categories/page.tsx` - ✅ Already using real data
- `app/products/[id]/page.tsx` - ✅ Fixed to use real data
